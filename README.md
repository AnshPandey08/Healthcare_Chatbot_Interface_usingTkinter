# Healthcare_Chatbot_Interface_usingTkinter
This project creates an interface for the simple healthcare platform.
This code sets up a basic GUI for a healthcare chatbot. When the user types in symptoms like "fever" or "headache", the bot provides a general response.
 Remember that this is a basic chatbot.
and any real health-related application would need far more sophisticated logic and disclaimers about not replacing professional medical advice
